## Future Development

As this application was required to be completed in a 12 hour window some of the outcomes where not as polished as I would have liked. Issues exist with deployment and data fetching however, neither hinder the application from performing well locally. This login/register form could have been completed much quicker and more efficiently by utilizing AWS and some of its built in features like Cognito for user authorization and Amplify for deployment. Being restricted to a new and smaller tech stack for this assignment was exciting and led to me learning a lot.
